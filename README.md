## Use Git and Github

### Step 1. Basics
  
  - Register a GitHub account
  - [Download Git for Windows:](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html#install-git-windows)
  - Configure Git:

  ```
  git config --global user.name 'Jane Doe'
  git config --global user.email 'jane@example.com'
  git config --global -list
  ```

  - [Connect to Github:](https://happygitwithr.com/push-pull-github.html#push-pull-github)
  
### Step 2. Create, modify, and update a Project

1. [Basics](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners)

2. [.gitignore](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/gitignore): Imagine that you have a very large raw dataset that you do not make changes to nor want to share with others.

```
# exclude everything except directory foo/bar

    !/foo/bar

```
  
### Step 3. Donwload (Fork) others' work and Contribute (Pull Request) to them 

1. [Fork a Repo](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository)

2. [Syncing a Fork]( https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/syncing-a-fork)

   - Tip: Syncing your fork only updates your local copy of the repository. To update your fork on GitHub, you must push your changes.
   - [**Warning:** Please enter a commit message to explain why this merge is necessary, especially if it merges an updated upstream into a topic branch](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19085807/please-enter-a-commit-message-to-explain-why-this-merge-is-necessary-especially)
   
3. [Create a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)

4. [Owner to Review a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/reviewing-proposed-changes-in-a-pull-request)
